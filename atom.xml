<p>##Day 3</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning: Met Client with Mrs. Na (who does trust) at Longgang. She is about 40, works in Pingan insurance, has a son. Her husband works in PE. She doesn't really want to buy trust but more about learning it as a a person of the same trade or business (Mrs. Na told me later and said she realized this soon). They discussed about their children first (three people: Mrs. Na, the Client Mrs. Liu, and the head of this brank bank Mrs. Wu, all of which have a child in high school). I find it really interesting because in China many discussion start with children. Mrs. Na said in China <strong>Family trust</strong> really started in 2018.
